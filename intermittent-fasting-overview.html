      <h2>What Is Intermittent Fasting?</h2>
      <p>Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that alternates between periods of eating and deliberate fasting. Rather than telling you what to eat, it structures <em>when</em> you eat. Common schedules include the 16:8 method (16 hours of fasting, 8-hour eating window), the 5:2 approach (two lower-calorie days per week), or early time-restricted feeding where meals are finished by mid-afternoon.</p>
      <p class="highlight">At its core, IF gives the body longer breaks from digestion, allowing insulin levels to fall, stored energy to be used efficiently, and cellular repair processes to activate.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits Backed by Research and Clinical Practice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved insulin sensitivity:</strong> Longer fasting windows lower circulating insulin, helping cells respond better to the hormone and stabilizing blood glucose over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic flexibility:</strong> Regular fasting trains the body to switch between burning glucose and stored fat, a key factor in sustained weight management.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for weight loss:</strong> Compressing eating times naturally reduces calorie intake for many people and may preserve lean mass when combined with adequate protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Cellular housekeeping:</strong> Periods without food stimulate autophagy—the removal of damaged cells—supporting longevity and healthy aging.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced inflammation:</strong> Some studies show lower inflammatory markers, which can benefit cardiovascular health and metabolic resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive clarity:</strong> Stable blood sugar and ketone production during fasting are often associated with steadier energy and focus.</li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Early adaptation may bring fatigue, irritability, or disrupted sleep.</li>
            <li>Potential for overeating or choosing low-quality foods during eating windows.</li>
            <li>Not suitable during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or for individuals with a history of disordered eating.</li>
            <li>Medication schedules—especially those affecting blood sugar—may need adjustment under medical supervision.</li>
            <li>Social meals or athletic training plans can be harder to coordinate.</li>

      <h2>Putting Intermittent Fasting Into Practice</h2>
      <p>Start gradually by extending the overnight fast an hour at a time, prioritizing hydration, balanced meals rich in lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats, and maintaining consistent sleep. Monitor energy, mood, training performance, and lab markers to gauge whether IF serves your goals.</p>
      <p>If you live with chronic conditions such as diabetes, take prescription medications, or have unique energy demands (athletes, shift workers, adolescents), partner with a healthcare professional to tailor the fasting schedule safely.</p>

      <strong>Expert Tip:</strong> Intermittent fasting is a tool, not a mandate. Success depends on nourishing food choices, stress management, and individual tolerance. Always seek personalized guidance when health conditions or life stages add complexity.
