      <p>
        Early humans began as hunter-gatherers, following animals and ripening plants. Over thousands of years,
        people experimented with planting seeds, domesticating animals, and saving the best harvests. This slow
        process led to the Agricultural Revolution. Growing food in one place meant families could build sturdier
        shelters, store extra grain, and share jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farming did not happen overnight. Communities tried different crops and tools based on their climate. Some
        groups grew wheat and barley, while others planted rice or maize. These experiments helped people discover
        which plants thrived in their region and how to protect them from pests or drought.

      <h2 id="daily-life">Daily Life in Early Communities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Homes:</strong> Mud-brick houses, woven reed roofs, and courtyards gave families space to cook and gather.</li>
        <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> As food supplies grew, some people specialized as toolmakers, potters, or traders.</li>
        <li><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Artifacts show that people honored nature, ancestors, and sky patterns with rituals and art.</li>
        <li><strong>Trading:</strong> People swapped obsidian, shells, spices, and stories with distant villages, spreading ideas quickly.</li>

        Early inventors were problem solvers. They shaped stone into chisels for building, spun fibers into textiles,
        and baked clay into durable pottery. The development of writing systems—like Mesopotamian cuneiform and
        Egyptian hieroglyphics—allowed leaders to record laws, merchants to track trades, and storytellers to preserve
        myths. These new tools and technologies helped civilizations organize and share knowledge across generations.

      <h2 id="river-civilizations">Why Rivers Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Rivers acted like superhighways of the ancient world. Yearly floods left behind rich silt that nourished
        crops. Communities dug irrigation canals to bring water to fields during dry seasons. Boats carried people
        and goods, connecting cities and encouraging cultural exchange. Living near rivers also required teamwork
        to control floods, which encouraged the development of governments and shared laws.

        Design a postcard from the point of view of a young artisan in an early city. Describe what you see, the
        tools you use, and how trade routes bring new ideas to your workshop. Share your postcard with a classmate and
        compare the similarities and differences between your civilizations.
