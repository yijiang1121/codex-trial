        <p>Hello! I’m running to be one of your student council representatives.</p>

        <p>I’m doing this for two main reasons. First, I want to make school lunch better. A lot of students have been complaining about the food. Second, I want to bring more fun to recess!</p>

        <p>Let me start with what I plan to do about school lunch.
        I’ll work on bringing more variety to the menu. Sometimes, the only option is a corn dog, and I think it would be great to have more choices — like different vegetables and protein options.</p>

        <p>I also want to improve the quality of the food. One time, a friend and I got yogurt that was expired. That shouldn’t happen. I believe it’s important for us to have healthy, high-quality meals.</p>

        <p>Now, about recess — I want to make it more fun by making sure there’s enough equipment for everyone. For example, we only have two bouncy balls at school, and a lot of kids want to use them but don’t get a turn.</p>

        <p>Thanks for listening! If you like my ideas, please vote for me!</p>
