        A friendly walkthrough of how modern large language models are built, trained, and refined. Use it as
        a quick primer before diving into technical papers or production deployments.

      <ol class="step-list">
        <li class="step">
          <strong>1. Plan the architecture.</strong>
          Decide how big the network should be, what layers it needs, and how data flows through it.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          <strong>2. Prepare massive, diverse datasets.</strong>
          Gather and clean text, code, images, or audio so the model can learn broad patterns.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          <strong>3. Pre-train on self-supervised objectives.</strong>
          Let the model predict masked tokens or next words so it develops general language intuition.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          <strong>4. Post-train for usefulness and safety.</strong>
          Align the model with user needs through instruction tuning, human feedback, and evaluation loops.

          <h3>Transformers Everywhere</h3>
          <p>
            Most large models use transformer blocks that mix attention layers and feed-forward networks. Attention lets
            the model focus on the most relevant words or tokens in the context.

          <h3>Scale and Capacity</h3>
          <p>
            Model <em>parameters</em> measure size. Scaling laws show that quality improves predictably as you increase
            parameters, data, and compute—provided all three grow together.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Tokens and Context</h3>
          <p>
            Training happens on tokenized text. Larger context windows allow the model to reference more prior tokens,
            improving coherence for long documents or conversations.

      <h2 id="pretraining">Pre-Training Fundamentals</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        Pre-training is a self-supervised marathon: the model learns statistical structure by predicting what comes
        next, without needing labeled answers for every example.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data quality matters:</strong> Deduplication, filtering, and balancing domains prevent the model from overfitting or memorizing noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective choice:</strong> Causal language modeling, masked language modeling, or multimodal objectives teach different habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Large-batch distributed training with adaptive optimizers (Adam, Adafactor) keeps learning stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Loss curves, validation sets, and compute budgets tell you when to stop or adjust hyperparameters.</li>

          <h3>Instruction Tuning</h3>
          <p>
            Fine-tune on curated prompt–response pairs so the model follows natural language instructions and stays on topic.

          <h3>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</h3>
          <p>
            Collect human preference data, train a reward model, and optimize the base model to produce responses users prefer.
