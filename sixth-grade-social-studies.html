      <p>
        Sixth graders travel across time and continents to discover how people adapted to their environments,
        formed belief systems, built governments, and exchanged ideas. Each unit blends geography, economics,
        civics, and history to show how societies grow more complex.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trace how rivers, landforms, and resources shape where people settle and how they live.</li>
        <li>Compare belief systems, civic structures, and cultural traditions across ancient regions.</li>
        <li>Analyze primary sources to understand multiple perspectives on the same historical moment.</li>
        <li>Build academic vocabulary that helps students explain cause and effect, continuity, and change.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Source sleuthing: examine who created a document, why it was produced, and what evidence it provides.</li>
        <li>Timeline design: organize events visually to see how innovations spread and intersect.</li>
        <li>Academic conversation: use accountable talk stems to build on classmates&rsquo; ideas and debate respectfully.</li>
        <li>Claim and evidence writing: support conclusions with facts from texts, visuals, and data sets.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="classroom-connections">
      <h2 id="classroom-connections">Classroom Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Connect social studies content to literacy, science, and art. Pair informational texts with hands-on labs,
        such as designing water wheels to model ancient irrigation systems, or compose travel journal entries from
        the viewpoint of a young trader visiting different regions.
